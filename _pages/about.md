Hi! I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Professor [Saurabh Gupta](https://saurabhg.web.illinois.edu/). Before this, I completed my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I was co-advised by Professor [Oliver Kroemer](https://labs.ri.cmu.edu/iam/) and Professor [Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com/). During my undergraduate studies at Carnegie Mellon, I worked with Professor [Andreas Pfenning](http://www.pfenninglab.org/) on multi-species genome alignment. I also spent two summers at Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ATG), contributing to both the *Simulation* and *Prediction* teams.
